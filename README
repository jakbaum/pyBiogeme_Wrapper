This script was developed while writing a thesis. It can be used to control BIOGEME (http://biogeme.epfl.ch/) to run a binary logit model with no attributes of the alternatives. Additionally, the ASC can be automatically adjusted which can used instead of a weighted ESML under certain circumstances (proof in Manski and Lerman 1977, pp. 1982-1985, referenced by Ben-Akiva and Lerman (1985, p. 237)).

The following steps are implemented:
(1) setup parameters
(2) call write_model_py.py which writes the model.py needed by pythonbiogeme into own subdirectory.
(3) call pythonbiogeme to run the model
(4) adjust the ASC in the output file (in case of a WESML scenario)
	and add confidence intervals to parameters (alpha=0.05, two-sided)
(5) display the output file in your browser

Please have a look into write_model_py.py to check and change e.g. the model type and various other things biogeme provides which are yet hardcoded in the script.

ToDo:
	- better error handling
	- relative instead of absolute paths
